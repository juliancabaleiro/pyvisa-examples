This is a 4 channels 16 bits 6 GHz oscilloscope with touch screen and W7 integrated inside. Integrate analog and digital measurement but firmware of some functions must be paid separatly.  
In the analog acquisition integrate the long term and statistics functions that are very usefull for take measurement.  
This is a high perfonace oscilloscope therefore the configuration of this is more complex that a common oscilloscope, for example:
-  Have a lot of commands for configure the layout of the the screen you can create figures, waveforms, measurements displays, change the sizes order that, print mensages or values in the figures, etc.
- Have a ADC that always acquire at 10 or 20 GS/s and use a undersamplig technique (tipically required), for that the channel configuration have a lot of option to select
- Have a probe configuration menu that have a lot of options to add external attenuation and more
