# Fluke 5500A Multiprocess Calibrator

This instrument is a laboratory voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, thermocouple reference used for calibration and characterization application.   
Here you can find some simple examples to how to use the instrument.  
Take special care when:  
- Use the current mode you don't generate abrupt change in current, specially care in inductive load
- Remember to make the auto-zero once a week (I recommend do this manually but is possible in remote mode)
- For safety when voltage or current increases or change internally the range the output is disabled and error code is generated
- Wait for the output to stabilize, take an estimated time or can consult with a special command, this is a reference instrument not a waveform generator give it adequate time to stabilize or change value.
- Pay attention to the connector's and wires with the power delivered for the instrument for safety and accurate measurement.
